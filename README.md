Job list app build for the frameworks exam 
by Agustin Pequeno

How to run the app:

In the main folder run npm start it will run the nodemon server and also serve the static file.
If you wanna also run the react app go to src/views/views and run npm start

Its the same if you want to install the node modules with npm i
